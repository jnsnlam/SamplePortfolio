<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Johnson Lam &mdash; I started learning more about web development and programming on a whim. I saw an online course for sale, and I decided to go for it. Luckily, I've had the patience to keep up with this for a while, and now look at me &mdash; developing my own website!</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time in the education sector &mdash; higher education, specifically. After graduating with my Master's in Higher Education, I have spent the early years of my professional career as an Academic Advisor, learning more about what types of work and interactions I enjoy, as well as ones I don't enjoy. My 20s truly have been a formative decade, and it's only fitting that I changed and evolved during them.</p>

<p>Now, I'm trying my hardest to chart my own course by doing things that I enjoy and am passionate about. Don't get me wrong &mdash; I loved working with students, and I think it's such a worthwhile pursuit. I have so enjoyed being there for my students and helping them see their own potential. But that has also opened my eyes to seeing my own potential and dreams, so I'm learning to follow that path. As I learn and grow as a creative developer and individual, I hope you get to see that potential and joy in my work.</p>
