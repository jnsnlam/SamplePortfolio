<h1>What are the best movies of all time?</h1>

<h2>I'm not sure, but I like these three:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fire Island</h3>

<p>A wonderfully queer and optimistic movie, I love watching this because of its diverse and talented cast.</p>

<h3>Nimona</h3>

<p>I thought the animation was interesting at first, but the story and dynamic and lovable characters kept me hooked.</p>

<h3>Love, Simon</h3>

<p>I had to make this list gay af, so don't come for me!</p>
